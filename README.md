# Shared Memory
A better description will be added later, but this is based off of this repo:
https://github.com/ShirasawaSama/JavaSharedMemory

It should be completely compatible with the other repo's implementation except I likely have different functions names and the such
But more or less they should be compatible

I'll add documentation later, though I'm only currently only planning on using this for myself
